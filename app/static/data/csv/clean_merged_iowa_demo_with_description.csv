seasons is the tree of five seasons sculpture in downtown along the north river bank the name five seasons and representations of the sculpture appear throughout the city in many forms history early history the location of presentday cedar rapids was in the territory of the fox and sac tribes at the time of european american settlement the first settler on the site of the future city was osgood shepherd who built a log cabin which he called a tavern in or next to the cedar river then known as the red cedar at what is now the corner of first avenue and first street northeast shepherd was a squatter who claimed the land without legal title and also a reputed neerdowell who if he was not a horse thief himself definitely consorted with them early on it appears that he jumped the claim of another squatter wilbert stone who had built a cabin and platted out a town some distance south of shepherds cabin that he called columbus shepherd drove stone across the river claiming that stone had built his cabin on shepherds land then sold stones cabin to a buyer named hull shepherd later tried the same tactic with perhaps the first settler on the west side of the river robert ellis but ellis happened to be chopping wood at the time and warned that someone would be dead if shepherd did not retreatthe true founders of the city were george greene nicholas brown and a few others brown had experience as a miller and greene had surveyed much of eastern iowa so both saw the value of the spot shepherd had claimed it was right next to the rapidsa prime spot to build a millthe last set of rapids on the river before the cedar fed into the iowa river meaning that goods milled on the spot could be carried by boat down river to the mississippi in they formed a partnership that bought out shepherds claim and platted out a town they called rapids city brown immediately constructed a primitive dam and then built the towns first mill his crude dam soon washed away prompting greene to induce alexander ely an engineer from michigan to build a proper dam that created a mill race capable of powering several millsat this time the city was confined to the east side of the river the west bank soon contained a village named kingston for resident david king who early on operated a rope ferry across the river the town was formally incorporated by the iowa state legislature on january as cedar rapids named for the rapids in the cedar river the river itself was named for the large number of red cedar trees that grew along its banks the population was less than during the s cedar rapids grew in size and it was during this decade that the czech population became substantial when the town was reincorporated in a quarter of its roughly inhabitants were czech immigrants the availability of cheap land in the new state of iowa happened to coincide with the revolutions of in the austrian empire that caused a large number of czechs to flee their homeland and emigrate to the us in the institution that eventually become coe college was founded in the same decade there were attempts by local leaders to improve the citys access to distant markets first through purchase of a steamboat aptly named cedar rapids and ultimately through investment in a railroad the first locomotive rolled into town on june railroads were an important factor in the development of the state and the growth of cities along the rail lines by the end of the th century the rd largest state was the fifth largest in track mileagein this same decade major john may an inventor and land speculator purchased the island now called mays island situated between cedar rapids and kingston with the intention of founding a town he called may island when that scheme proved impractical due to the islands tendency to flood he conceived the idea of making his island the center of a larger city that spanned the river and convinced the state legislature to officially name the land he had bought there just south of kingston west cedar rapidscedar rapids annexed the community of kingston in and constructed an iron bridge across the river along the line of the current third avenue bridge the economic growth of cedar rapids increased in upon the founding of the sinclair meatpacking company the plant allowed for yearround meatpacking because ice could be harvested from the cedar river in winter to chill an icehouse and within a few years it became one of the largest factories of its kind in the country employing people in the oatmeal mill that ultimately became the flagship operation of the quaker oats company and the largest cereal mill in the world was built in the city acquired mays island for the purpose of making it the seat of government then as now there were ill feelings between east and westsiders in cedar rapids and the citys leaders hoped that putting city hall in the neutral territory of the island would help ease tensions in the residents of linn county voted to move the county seat from marion to cedar rapids partially because cedar rapids had offered to donate the southern third of the island as a site for a new county courthouse and jail flood of during the iowa flood of

occurring in a given year more than homes were affected causing over people to evacuate the cedar rapids schools were closed for a weekin cedar rapids approved a million flood protection plan over years for levee improvements although the improvement to the levee system in cedar rapids had not been completed due to over million in funding not appropriated by the united states congresses of and and the voting down by local residents of a temporary increase in the local sales tax to pay for the levee improvements out of school students along with hundreds of thousands of volunteers and iowa national guard troops filled more than a quarter of a million sandbags in a successful effort to prevent any major flooding of the city outside the evacuation zone a mile km system of hesco barriers earthen berms and over sandbags were used to plug the gaps in the levee system the city of cedar rapids purchased additional hesco barriers from iowa city for million numerous upstream cities that had been earlier affected by the september flooding and mandatory evacuations including charles city greene manchester clarksville shell rock vinton janesville cedar falls and waterloo sent hundreds of thousands of unused sandbags to support efforts in cedar rapids and nearby communities the remnants of hurricane paine did not produce any rain to saturate the temporary earth berms and sandbags which

leave the chicago area under the treaty of chicago clearing the way for the city of chicago to incorporate the largest group of native americans who moved to the area were the pottawatomi who were led by their chief sauganash one who speaks english the son of the british loyalist william caldwell who founded canadian communities on the south side of the detroit river and a pottawatomi woman seeking to avoid confrontation with the sioux who were natives of the council bluffs area the to pottawattamie initially had settled east of the missouri river in indian territory between leavenworth kansas

contributed to joseph nicollets work in mapping the upper midwest de smet produced the first europeanrecorded detailed map of the council bluffs area it detailed the missouri river valley system from below the platte river to the big sioux river de smet wrote an early description of the potawatomi settlement imagine a great number of cabins and tents made of the bark of trees buffalo skins coarse cloth rushes and sods all of a mournful and funereal aspect of all sizes and shapes some supported by one pole others having six and with the covering stretched in all the different styles imaginable and all scattered here and there in the greatest confusion and you will have an indian village as more native americans were pushed into the council bluffs area by pressure of europeanamerican settlement to the east intertribal conflict increased fueled by the illegal whiskey trade the us army built fort croghan in to keep order and try to control liquor traffic on the missouri river

the newly expanded united states western lands after the first large organized wagon trains left missouri in the annual migration waves began in earnest by the spring of they built up thereafter with the opening of the mormon trail and peaked in the later s when news of the progress of railroads had a braking effect on the number of travelers by the s virtually all migration wagon trains passed near the town now named council bluffs the wagon train trails became less important with the advent of the first complete transcontinental railway in but while trail use diminished after that their use continued on at lesser rates until late in the nineteenth century the mormon battalion began its march from kanesville to california during the mexicanamerican war the area was where plural

county iowa united states the population was at the census history independence was founded on june near the center of presentday buchanan county the original town plat was a simple nineblock grid on the east side of the wapsipinicon river the town was intended as an alternative to quasqueton then called quasequetuk which was the county seat prior to the village of independence had fewer than persons when the county seat was transferred there on main street on the west bank of the wapsipinicon a sixstory grist mill was built in some of its foundation stones were taken from that of an earlier mill the new haven mill built in that was used for wool processing prior to the incorporation of independence on october a shortlived neighboring village called new haven had grown up on the west side of the river hence the name new haven mill the mill now called the wapsipinicon mill was a source of electrical energy from to some structural restoration occurred in recent years and the mill now functions partly as an historical museum a courthouse was built in on the east side of the town on a site described at that time as the highest tract of land in the neighborhood where offers a fine view of the city of independence the valley of the wapsipinicon and the surrounding country the original courthouse was replaced in by a moderne or art deco structure among the towns distinctions has been the longterm presence of the independence state hospital formerly called the iowa state hospital for the insane located on a large remote tract of land on the west edge of town the recently restored main building called the reynolds building made of native prairie granite in french second empire style was built in today it is open to the public for scheduled tours for a few years in the late s and early s independence was a nationally known horseracing center and was sometimes referred to as the lexington of the north this came about as a result of the meteoric financial success of charles w williams a telegraph operator and creamery owner from nearby jesup iowa williams with no experience in breeding horses purchased in two mares each of which within a year gave birth to a stallion these two stallions which williams named axtel and allerton went on the set world trotting records with the result that williams earnings enabled him to publish a racing newspaper titled the american trotter to build a large threestory hotel and opera house called the gedney and to construct a figureeight shaped race track on the west edge of town on a large section of land called rush park where he also built a magnificent horse barn his family mansion and peripheral structures the burgeoning community was soon home to other mansions churches and even a trolleycar service williams went on to raise other recordbreaking horses but he lost much of his fortune in the panic of williams subsequently moved to galesburg illinois where among other things he became acquainted with the young carl sandburg as mentioned in sandburgs autobiography always the young strangers today the location of williams race track which was the original site of the buchanan county fairgrounds is a corn field his house is still standing but in recent years the rush park barn was demolished by a bulldozer to make way for a fastfood drivein and an auto parts store in the years that followed the race track days the town lost most of its importance when the railroad terminal at independence was pushed further west to waterloo iowa it is not widely known that independence has an historical connection with the americanborn writer gertrude stein while living in paris stein became close friends with an american expatriate painter named william edwards cook who was born in independence in it was cook who taught stein how to drive so that she could transport supplies for the french during world war i in her second autobiography titled everybodys autobiography she talks about her fondness for the state and for cooks hometown in particular which she had never visited although as a child in san francisco she was well aware of the towns sudden celebrity as a horse racing center her fondness for iowa is also partly attributable to her close friendship with american writer carl van vechten who would become her literary executor who had grown up in nearby cedar rapids iowa in when stein traveled throughout the us on a book publicity tour she eagerly agreed to speak at iowa city on the second floor of what is now the prairie lights bookstore with the provision that she would be able to fly over independence to see cooks birthplace from the air unfortunately the midwest was hit by a major winter storm that day and steins visit to iowa was entirely cancelled cook himself had returned to independence for an extended visit in to assist in settling the affairs of his father an independence lawyer who had died the year before when cook returned to paris he used part of his inheritance to commission a young architect named le corbusier to design on the outskirts of paris what is now considered to be one of the first cubist houses called maison cook or villa cook the race track at rush park has also the distinction of being the site of the first onemile bicycle speed record of under two minutes which was set in at independence by john s johnson of additional interest are several other buildings of historic and architectural value among these are the christian seeland house and brewery at th street northeast an italianate style mansion and brewery saint johns roman catholic church at nd street and th avenue northeast the munson building formerly the independence free public library at nd street northeast saint james

the city maquoketa caves state park is located a few miles northwest of maquoketa the population was at the time of the census history john e goodenow the inaugural settler in the region arrived in what is now recognized as maquoketa in he established his residence on the presentday southeast corner of main and platt streets erecting a cabin in that vicinity by zalmon livermore had acquired the quarter section on the northeast corner of this intersection while alonzo spaulding claimed the northwest corner and john shaw occupied the southwest corner the center of todays business district was originally the epicenter of this early settlement known at the time as springfield the towns growth was propelled by two key factors its strategic location at the intersection of the davenporttodubuque mail and stage route as well as its proximity to the path used by pioneers traveling from chicago to the west additionally the abundance of water in the area facilitated the development of industries along the north and south forks of the maquoketa riveraround the mail route between davenport and dubuque was established through springfield located on what is now main street in maquoketa consequently the post office moved to springfield with john goodenow appointed as postmaster in due to multiple towns named springfield in the area the town was renamed maquoketa after the maquoketa river was adopted in the rivers name derives from maquawautaw which means bear river in meskwakias other nearby towns declined maquoketa emerged as the primary center of commerce in early settlers began dividing their land into lots informally resulting in the irregular lot sizes seen in the modern business district with the increasing settlement and the importance of the mail route demand for lodging grew in john goodenow built the goodenow house the towns first hotel near main and platt streets drawing visitors and showcasing maquoketas potential for growththe davenport and st paul railroad was extended to maquoketa in prompting growth the county seat was transferred from andrew to maquoketa in maquoketa experienced a period of economic growth during the late th century primarily due to its location near valuable natural resources such as timber limestone and fertile farmland as the town prospered wealthy residents sought to display their affluence through the construction of grand homes many of which are still extant within the community the onset of the first world war in significantly affected the commercial district numerous businesses experienced the loss of young male employees either through voluntary enlistment or compulsory military service upon the wars conclusion in returning soldiers were ceremoniously welcomed home with parades along main streetfollowing the stock market crash of the great depression brought a halt to construction activity in the commercial district the american savings bank closed its doors leading to the renovation of its building at s main street in the revamped structure housed a national tea company grocery store on the ground floor and served as meeting space for the american legion above this renovation which included the removal of classical pilasters and the installation of modern storefront materials signaled a shift in the districts architectural landscape despite these changes maquoketa experienced relatively moderate economic effects compared to other regions likely due to its strategic location at the intersection of two commercial highwaysafter world war ii maquoketa iowa experienced a surge in residential construction particularly on the west side of town many of these homes were constructed on old farmland this rapid suburbanization not only met the housing needs of the time but also contributed to the towns postwar growth and prosperity in maquoketa iowa reached a significant milestone in its healthcare infrastructure by constructing its first public hospital prior to this development the town had relied on a patchwork of privatelyrun small hospitals to meet the healthcare needs of its residents these small hospitals while providing essential services often faced limitations in terms of capacity resources and accessibility maquoketa experienced another pivotal moment with the relocation of the clinton machine company to the city in don thomas spearheaded this move establishing the company on a acre plot within maquoketa strategically leveraging a rail spur for transportation clinton engines a division of the company became a powerhouse producing approximately million small engines and ranking as the th largest employer in iowa in the s maquoketa iowa witnessed the emergence of a new commercial district main street formerly part of us highway underwent a significant transformation with the planning and construction of a fourlane highway bypass starting in the late s as the bypass project progressed many businesses along main street made plans to relocate to the west side of town in anticipation of increased automobile traffic from the highway following the opening of the highway bypass in there was a notable shift in commercial activity away from main street towards the new commercial district despite this disinvestment in the main street area property owners remained committed to maintaining the integrity of the existing buildings ensuring they remained in good repairduring the s many towns in jackson county iowa faced significant challenges particularly due to the farm crisis that devastated rural communities across the region while the county as a whole experienced population declines and economic hardships maquoketa saw only minor decreases in its population nevertheless the farm crisis did have negative repercussions for maquoketa impacting local agricultural businesses and contributing to a sense of economic uncertainty within the community in the town was bypassed by the now four lane highway sixtyone further diverting traffic away from the downtown area this highway bypass had detrimental effects on maquoketas economy as it resulted in decreased traffic flow through the town center affecting local businesses that relied on passing trade additionally the bypass diminished maquoketas visibility and accessibility further exacerbating economic challenges for the community despite these setbacks maquoketa persisted in its efforts to adapt and evolve seeking new avenues for economic growth and community development in the face of adversity the early s posed significant economic challenges for maquoketa iowa exacerbating the struggles of its downtown district already grappling with vacant storefronts and declining economic activity the town faced further hardship during this period including the closure of the clinton engines company however the most devastating blow came on january th when a large portion of the downtown area already struggling succumbed to a devastating fire while tragic this event served as a catalyst for change sparking renewed efforts to revitalize the downtown district and enhance the overall community beginning in the s maquoketa experienced a wave of revitalization marked by the attraction of new businesses significant infrastructure investments and a renewed focus on preserving its historic downtown district one notable development was the construction of a new hospital in enhancing healthcare services for residents additionally maquoketa embarked on ambitious housing initiatives including the construction of new
